                    <p>Joining a Living-Learning Program enables students to have an all-encompassing learning experience. Students can combine experiential learning opportunities with a vibrant residence life experience. Students join Living-Learning Programs in cohorts, and experience courses, service, and co-curricular activities together. The shared experiences of these students help to build a feeling of community and a sense of belonging and purpose at VCU. Students’ peers in a Living-Learning Program will become lifelong friends and help with professional networking as well. Furthermore, living-learning programs enable students, through coursework and co-curricular events, to develop skills and to gain knowledge in the specific theme of the living-learning community.</p>

			<p><strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best part of being in a living-learning community is that I am able to experience more out of a university and the community we reside in. VCU is a huge campus with lots of organizations you can be wrapped up in due to general body meetings and the occasional events. In a living-learning community, there really isn't a such thing as a general body meeting. We're living WITH those students and learning from each other day-to-day. We can also share our past experiences while also creating new ones with people you wouldn't have normally been able to meet due to your major or just your schedule. It's a very humbling experience to be a part of and I believe that it enriched my time here at VCU, Richmond, and the world!</span></strong></p>
